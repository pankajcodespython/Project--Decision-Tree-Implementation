This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree classifier on the Iris dataset, one of the most popular datasets in machine learning. 
The objective was to build a model that can accurately classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.
Project Workflow:
Data Preprocessing – Loaded the Iris dataset, checked for missing values, and split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Development – Implemented a Decision Tree classifier using Scikit-learn, experimenting with different criteria (Gini Index & Entropy) and hyperparameters (max depth, min samples split).
Evaluation – Evaluated model accuracy using metrics such as confusion matrix, classification report, and cross-validation.
Visualization – Plotted the Decision Tree to interpret decision paths and feature importance.
Outcome:
Achieved >95% accuracy in classifying iris species.
Identified petal length and petal width as the most significant features in prediction.
Demonstrated the interpretability and practical use of Decision Trees for classification problems.
